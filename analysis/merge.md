# 🧩 Merge Sort – Summary Analysis

## Time Complexity
- The time graph shows **steady linear-logarithmic growth**, meaning Merge Sort scales efficiently with increasing input size.  
- The growth rate matches its theoretical complexity of **O(n log n)**, as seen by the smooth increase in execution time.  
- It performs consistently because the array is always divided into halves, regardless of the data order.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity graph rises linearly with input size since Merge Sort requires additional memory for merging subarrays.  
- This confirms a **space complexity of O(n)** due to the use of temporary arrays during merging.

## ➡️ Conclusion
Merge Sort demonstrates **efficient and predictable performance**, with **O(n log n)** time and **O(n)** space complexity.  
It is **stable**, suitable for large datasets, and preferred when consistent performance is needed, though it uses extra memory for merging.
